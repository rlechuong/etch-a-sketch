# etch-a-sketch

1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

2. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

3. Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

Extra Credit:

1. Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.

2. Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.
